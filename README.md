# Jmix MVC Freemarker sample

This repository contains [Jmix](https://jmix.io) application with Backoffice UI and Spring MVC UI.
The project demonstrates the ability to build Spring MVC UI using strong backend stuff provided by
the [Jmix](https://jmix.io) regardless of the Backoffice UI which is accessible out-of-the-box
and can be used as a second UI for building the admin part of the application or for something else.

## Usage

Besides the usual Jmix Backoffice UI scenario, you can use the following URLs 
`http://localhost:8080/portal/**` to access the Spring MVC UI which
built on Freemarker template engine. `http://localhost:8080/portal/users` - users
page.
